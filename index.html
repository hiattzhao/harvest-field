<h2>Ready for the Holidays? How about the gift of giving by recycling!</h2>
 
<p>Hi, my name is Hiatt and I live on 5315 Hope Ln. I am starting a recycling program on repairing old and used computers around the neighborhood. It is a free service where I take a look at your computer, with everything in tact, and try to fix it. If my repair is successful you get to choose whether someone else <b>in the neighborhood</b> can have it for free, or you get to keep it yourself. If I am unable to fix it I will either return it to you or recycle it at the nearest recycling center.
</p>

<h2>How it Works</h2>

<ol>
	<li>FInd your broken or old computer with all the parts.</li>
	<li>Contact me via the form below.</li>
	<li>I will take a look at your computer and try to fix it.</li>
	<li>If successfully repaired, you have the option of giving it to another neighbor or keeping it yourself.</li>
	<li>If unsuccessful, you can keep the computer or let me recycle it for you.</li>
</ol>

<h2>The Details</h2>

<ul>
	<li>If it's a part that's broken I will let you know and see if you want to order it.</li>
	<li>If there's a problem with an essential software I will let you know.</li>
	<li>If it's an operating system problem I will let you know and may install a free Linux OS.</li>
	<li>As always, I will fix your computer as best as I can free of charge.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Benefit to the Environment</h2>

<p>We all know that trashed electronics produce e-waste. There are actually <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1870485,00.html" title="Chinese villages" target="_blank">entire villages in China</a> that are solely dedicated to recycling our electronic waste. In doing so the villagers also pollute their rivers and the water system causing all kinds of health damages to themselves and to mother Earth. As citizens of the world we need to do something to reduce our unnecessary consumption and recycle our household waste, especially electronic waste that's hard to get rid of.</p>
